    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP data selection configuration In addition to the data source configuration, you need to provide a data selection configuration to specify the data you want the adapter to collect from the data sources. Configure Modbus TCP data selection You cannot modify Modbus TCP data selection configurations manually. You must use the REST endpoints to add or edit the configuration. Complete the following procedure to configure the Modbus TCP data selection: Using any text editor, create a file that contains a Modbus TCP data selection in the JSON format. For content structure, see Modbus TCP data selection examples . For a table of all available parameters, see Modbus TCP data selection parameters . Save the file. For example, DataSelection.config.json . Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to execute either a POST or PUT command to their appropriate endpoint: Note: The following examples use Modbus1 as the adapter component name. For more information on how to add a component, see System components configuration . 5590 is the default port number. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value. POST endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<componentId>/DataSelection/ Example using curl : Note: Run this command from the same directory where the file is located. curl -d \"@DataSelection.config.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/Modbus1/DataSelection\" PUT endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<componentId>/DataSelection/<Id> Example using curl : Note: Run this command from the same directory where the file is located. curl -d \"@DataSelection.config.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/Modbus1/DataSelection/DataItem1\" Modbus TCP data selection schema The full schema definition for the Modbus data selection configuration is in the Modbus_DataSelection_schema.json file located in one of the folders listed below: Windows: %ProgramFiles%\\OSIsoft\\Adapters\\Modbus\\Schemas Linux: /opt/OSIsoft/Adapters/Modbus/Schemas Modbus TCP data selection parameters The following parameters are available to configure a Modbus TCP data selection: Parameter Required Type Description Id Optional string Updates an existing measurement. The ID automatically updates when there are changes to the measurement and follows the format of <DeviceId >. <UnitId >. <RegisterType >. <RegisterOffset >. DeviceId Required string Specifies the DataSource device that this data selection item will be read from. The value must match one of the <Id> values specified in the DataSource Devices configuration. Selected Optional boolean Selects or clears a measurement. To select an item, set to true . To remove an item, leave the field empty or set to false. If not configured, the default value is true . Name Optional string The optional friendly name of the data item collected from the data source. If not configured, the default value will be the stream ID. UnitId Required number Modbus TCP slave device unit ID. This must be a value between 0 and 247, inclusively. RegisterType Required number or string Modbus TCP register type. Supported types are Coil , Discrete , Input16 , Input32 , Holding16 and Holding32 . Input16 and Holding16 are used to read registers that have a size of 16 bits. For registers that have a size of 32 bits, use the Input32 and Holding32 register types. To represent the types, you can type in the register type ID or the exact name: 1 or Coil (Read Coil Status) 2 or Discrete (Read Discrete Input Status) 3 or Holding16 (Read 16-bit Holding Registers) 4 or Holding32 (Read 32-bit Holding Registers) 6 or Input16 (Read 16-bit Input Registers) 7 or Input32 (Read 32-bit Input Registers) For more information, see Register types . RegisterOffset Required number The 0 relative offset to the starting register for this measurement. For example, if your Holding registers start at base register 40001, the offset to this register is 0. For 40002, the offset to this register is 1. DataTypeCode Required number An integer representing the data type that the adapter will read starting at the register specified by the offset. Supported data types are: 1 = Boolean 10 = Int16 20 = UInt16 30 = Int32 31 = Int32ByteSwap 100 = Float32 101 = Float32ByteSwap 110 = Float64 111 = Float64ByteSwap 1001 - 1250 = String 2001 - 2250 = StringByteSwap ScheduleId Required string The id of an existing schedule for reading values. BitMap Optional string The bitmap is used to extract and reorder bits from a word register. The format of the bitmap is uuvvwwxxyyzz, where uu, vv, ww, yy, and zz each refer to a single bit. A leading zero is required if the referenced bit is less than 10. The low-order bit is 01 and high-order bit is either 16 or 32. Up to 16 bits can be referenced for a 16-bit word (data types 10 and 20) and up to 32 bits can be referenced for a 32-bit word (data type 30 and 31). The bitmap 0307120802 maps the second bit of the original word to the first bit of the new word, the eighth bit to the second bit, the twelfth bit to the third bit, and so on. The high-order bits of the new word are padded with zeros if they are not specified. ConversionFactor Optional number Use this numerical value to scale the raw response received from the Modbus TCP device. If you specify ConversionFactor, regardless of the specified data type, the value is promoted to a float32 (single) when stored. [Result = (Value / Conversion Factor)] ConversionOffset Optional number Use this numerical value to apply an offset to the response received from the Modbus TCP device. If you specify ConversionOffset, regardless of the specified data type, the value is promoted to a float32 (single) when stored. [Result = (Value - Conversion Offset)] DataFilterId Optional string If you want data filtering for this data selection item, specify the name of an existing data filter. If you do not specify the value or set it null , all values read are output without being filtered. StreamID Optional string The custom stream ID that will be used to create the streams. If you do not specify the StreamID, the adapter generates a default stream ID based on the measurement configuration. A properly configured custom stream ID follows these rules: Is not case-sensitive. Can contain spaces. Cannot start with two underscores (\"__\"). Can contain a maximum of 100 characters. Cannot use the following characters: / : ? # [ ] @ ! $ & ' ( ) \\ * + , ; = % < > ` Each JSON object in the file represents a measurement. You can modify the fields in each object to configure the measurement parameters. To add more measurements, you need to create more JSON objects with properly completed fields. Register types Register types are used to configure measurements in Modbus TCP data selection. The adapter supports six register types, corresponding to four function codes (1-4). Since one function code can return two types of registers, 16-bit or 32-bit depending on the device, either the register type or the register type code is required when configuring the data selection for the adapter. The following table lists all the register types supported in the adapter. Register Type Register Type Code Description Function Code Coil 1 Read Coil Status 1 Discrete 2 Read Discrete Input Status 2 Holding16 3 Read 16-bit Holding Registers 3 Holding32 4 Read 32-bit Holding Registers 3 Input16 6 Read 16-bit Input Registers 4 Input32 7 Read 32-bit Input Registers 4 When reading from function codes 1 and 2 , the adapter expects these to be returned as single bits. For function codes 3 and 4 , the adapter expects 16 bits to be returned from devices that contain 16-bit registers and 32 bits to be returned from devices that contain 32-bit registers.

    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP overview The OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP is a data-collection component that transfers time-series data from source devices to OMF endpoints in OSIsoft Cloud Services or PI Servers. Modbus TCP is a commonly available communication protocol used for connecting and transmitting information between industrial electronic devices. The adapter can connect to any device that uses the Modbus TCP communication protocol. The adapter is installed with a download kit obtained from the OSIsoft Customer Portal and works on devices running either Windows or Linux operating systems. All functions of the adapter are configured using the REST API. The configurations are stored in JSON files. For data ingress, you must define an adapter component in the system components configuration for each device to which the adapter will connect. You configure each adapter component with the connection information for the device and the data to collect. For data egress, you must specify destinations for the data, including security for the outgoing connection. Additional configurations are available to egress health and diagnostics data, add buffering configuration to protect against data loss, and record logging information for troubleshooting purposes. Once you have configured the adapter and it is sending data, administration functions are used to manage the adapter or individual ingress components of the adapter. Health and diagnostics functions monitor the status of connected devices, adapter system functions, the number of active data streams, the rate of data ingress, the rate of errors, and the rate of data egress. The EdgeCmd utility is an OSIsoft proprietary command line tool that is used to configure and administer an adapter on both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is installed separately from the adapter. <!-- # OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP ======= - [OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP overview](xref:OSIsoftAdapterForModbusTCPOverview) - [OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP principles of operation](xref:OSIsoftAdapterForModbusTCPPrinciplesOfOperation) - [OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP supported features](xref:OSIsoftAdapterForModbusTCPSupportedFeatures) - [Installation](xref:Installation) - [Install the adapter](xref:InstallTheAdapter) - [Install OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP using Docker](xref:InstallOSIsoftAdapterForModbusTCPUsingDocker) - [Uninstall the adapter](xref:UninstallTheAdapter) - [Configuration](xref:ModbusConfiguration) - [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools) - [System components configuration](xref:SystemComponentsConfiguration) - [OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP data source configuration](xref:OSIsoftAdapterForModbusTCPDataSourceConfiguration) - [OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP data selection configuration](xref:OSIsoftAdapterForModbusTCPDataSelectionConfiguration) - [Egress endpoints configuration](xref:EgressEndpointsConfiguration) - [Health endpoint configuration](xref:HealthEndpointConfiguration) - [Diagnostics configuration](xref:DiagnosticsConfiguration) - [Buffering configuration](xref:BufferingConfiguration) - [Logging configuration](xref:LoggingConfiguration) - [System and adapter configuration](xref:SystemAndAdapterConfiguration) - [Administration](xref:Administration) - [Start and stop an adapter](xref:StartAndStopAnAdapter) - [Start and stop ingress component](xref:StartAndStopIngressComponent) - [Retrieve product version information](xref:RetrieveProductVersionInformation) - [Delete an adapter component](xref:DeleteAnAdapterComponent) - [Health and diagnostics](xref:HealthAndDiagnostics) - [Adapter health](xref:AdapterHealth) - [Device status](xref:DeviceStatus) - [Next health message expected](xref:NextHealthMessageExpected) - [Adapter diagnostics](xref:AdapterDiagnostics) - [System](xref:System) - [Stream count](xref:StreamCount) - [IO rate](xref:IORate) - [Error rate](xref:ErrorRate) - [Egress diagnostics](xref:EgressDiagnostics) -->"

Note: If you want to use Docker, you must be familiar with the underlying technology and have determined that it is appropriate for your planned use of the Modbus TCP adapter. Docker is not required to use the Modbus TCP adapter. This topic provides examples of how to create a Docker container with the Modbus TCP adapter. Create a startup script for the adapter Using any text editor, create a script similar to one of the following: Note: The script varies slightly by processor.

Create a Docker container containing the Modbus TCP adapter Create the following Dockerfile in the directory where you want to create and run the container. Note: Dockerfile is the required name for the file. Use the variation according to your operating system: ARM32 FROM ubuntu WORKDIR / RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y ca-certificates libicu66 libssl1.1 curl COPY modbusdockerstart.sh / RUN chmod +x /modbusdockerstart.sh ADD ./Modbus_linux-arm.tar.gz .

ENTRYPOINT [\"/modbusdockerstart.sh\"] Copy the Modbus_linux-\\<platform>.tar.gz file to the same directory as the Dockerfile . Copy the modbusdockerstart.sh script to the same directory as the Dockerfile . Run the following command line in the same directory ( sudo may be necessary): docker build -t modbusadapter . Run the Modbus TCP adapter Docker container REST access from the local host to the Docker container Complete the following to run the container: Use the docker container image modbusadapter previously created. Type the following in the command line ( sudo may be necessary): docker run -d --network host modbusadapter Port 5590 is accessible from the host and you can make REST calls to Modbus TCP adapter from applications on the local host computer. In this example, all data stored by the Modbus TCP adapter is stored in the container itself. When you delete the container, the stored data is also deleted. Provide persistent storage for the Docker container Complete the following to run the container: Use the docker container image modbusadapter previously created. Type the following in the command line ( sudo may be necessary): docker run -d --network host -v /modbus:/usr/share/OSIsoft/ modbusadapter Port 5590 is accessible from the host and you can make REST calls to Modbus TCP adapter from applications on the local host computer. In this example, all data that is written to the container is instead written to the host directory and the host directory is a directory on the local machine, /modbus . You can specify any directory. Port number change To use a different port other than 5590 , you can specify a portnum variable on the docker run command line. For example, to start the adapter using port 6000 instead of 5590 , you use the following command: docker run -d -e portnum=6000 --network host modbusadapter This command accesses the REST API with port 6000 instead of port 5590 . The following curl command returns the configuration for the container. curl http://localhost:6000/api/v1/configuration Remove REST access to the Docker container If you remove the --network host option from the docker run command, REST access is not possible from outside of the container. This may be valuable when you want to host an application in the same container as the Modbus TCP adapter, but you do not want external REST access enabled."

Messages with a severity below the level set are not included. The log levels in their increasing order of severity are as follows: Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical, None. For detailed information about the logLevels, see LogLevel . logFileSizeLimitBytes Optional integer The maximum size (in bytes) of log files that the service will create for the component. It must be a positive integer. logFileCountLimit Optional integer The maximum number of log files that the service will create for the component. It must be a positive integer. LogLevel Level Description Trace Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data like actual received values, which is why these messages should not be enabled in production environment. Debug Logs that can be used to troubleshoot data flow issues by recording metrics and detailed flow related information. Information Logs that track the general flow of the application. Any non-repetitive general information like the following can be useful for diagnosing potential application errors: - Version information related to the software at startup - External services used - Data source connection string - Number of measurements - Egress URL - Change of state “Starting” or “Stopping” - Configuration Warning Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow that does not otherwise cause the application execution to stop. Warning messages can indicate an unconfigured data source state, that a communication with backup failover instance has been lost, an insecure communication channel in use, or any other event that could require attention, but that does not impact data flow. Error Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity and not an application-wide failure. It can indicate an invalid configuration, unavailable external endpoint, internal flow error, and so on. Critical Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention. This can indicate application wide failures like beta timeout expired, unable to start self-hosted endpoint, unable to access vital resource (for example, Data Protection key file), and so on. None Logging is disabled for the given component. Example Default logging configuration By default, logging captures Information, Warning, Error, and Critical messages in the message logs.

While the files are accessible to view, OSIsoft recommends that you use REST or the EdgeCmd utility for any changes you make to the files. As part of making adapters as secure as possible, any passwords or secrets that you configure are stored in encrypted form where cryptographic key material is stored separately in a secure location. If you edit the files directly, the adapter may not work as expected. Note: You can edit any single component or facet of the system individually using REST, but you can also configure the system as a whole with a single REST call.

ComponentType corresponds to the adapter type. For example, Modbus or OpcUa. Metadata for health and diagnostics streams If you configure a health endpoint and enable metadata, they are included in the health streams ( Device status and Next health message expected ) together with ComponentId and ComponentType . If you enable diagnostics in General configuration , metadata are included in the diagnostics streams ( Stream count , IO rate , Error rate ) together with ComponentId and ComponentType . The adapter may also send its own stream metadata not including health and diagnostics streams. For more information about what custom metadata is included in each stream, see the user guide for your adapter. Note: Metadata is only sent for streams created by the ingress components. Currently, the only endpoint that persists sent metadata is OCS (OSIsoft Cloud Services). Metadata in OCS"

    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP principles of operation This adapters's operations focus on data collection and stream creation. Adapter configuration For the Modbus TCP adapter to start data collection, configure the following: Data source: Provide the data source from which the adapter should collect data. Data selection: Select Modbus TCP items to which the adapter should subscribe for data. Logging: Set up the logging attributes to manage the adapter logging behavior. For more details, see OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP data source configuration and OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP data selection configuration . Connection The adapter communicates with the Modbus TCP devices through the TCP/IP network by sending request packets that are constructed based on the data selection configurations. It collects the response packets returned by the devices. Data collection The adapter collects data from the Modbus TCP devices at the polling rates that you specify. The rates are set in each of the data selection configurations and can range from 0 milliseconds (as fast as possible) up to 1 day per polling. The adapter automatically optimizes the data collection process by grouping the requests to reduce the I/O load imposed to the Modbus TCP networks. Data types The adapter converts readings from single or multiple registers into the data types specified by the data type code and populates the value into streams. The following table lists all data types with their corresponding type codes supported by the adapter. Data type code Data type name Value type Register type Description 1 Boolean Boolean Bool 0 = false 1 = true 10 Int16 Int16 Bool/16-bit Read 1 Modbus TCP register and interpret as a 16-bit integer. Bytes [BA] read from the device are stored as [AB]. 20 UInt16 UInt16 Bool/16-bit Read 1 Modbus TCP register and interpret as an unsigned 16-bit integer. Bytes [BA] read from the device are stored as [AB]. 30 Int32 Int32 16-bit/32-bit Read 32 bits from the Modbus TCP device and interpret as a 32-bit integer. Bytes [DCBA] read from the device are stored as [ABCD]. 31 Int32ByteSwap Int32 16-bit/32-bit Read 32 bits from the Modbus TCP device and interpret as a 32-bit integer. Bytes [BADC] read from the device are stored as [ABCD]. 100 Float32 Float32 16-bit/32-bit Read 32 bits from the Modbus TCP device and interpret as a 32-bit float.

Bytes [AB] are interpreted as \"AB\". 2001 - 2250 StringByteSwap String 16-bit/32-bit 2001 reads a one-character string, 2002 reads a two-character string, and 2003 reads a three-character string and so on. Bytes [BA] are interpreted as \"AB\". Stream creation From the parsed data selection configurations, the adapter creates types, streams, and data based on the information provided. For each measurement in the data selection configuration, a stream is created to store time series data. Streams by Modbus TCP adapter For each data selection configuration, the adapter creates a stream with two properties, which are described in the following table: Property name Data type Description Timestamp String The response time of the stream data from the Modbus TCP device Value Specified by the data selection The value of the stream data from the Modbus TCP device Certain metadata are sent with each stream created. Metadata common for every adapter type are ComponentId : Specifies the type of adapter, for example Modbus ComponentType : Specifies the data source, for example Modbus1 Each stream created for the selected measurement has a unique identifier or \"Stream ID.\" If you specify a custom stream ID for the measurement in the data selection configuration, the adapter uses that stream ID to create the stream. Otherwise, the adapter constructs the stream ID using the following format: <Adapter Component ID>.<Device ID>.<Unit ID>.<Register Type>.<Register Offset> Note: Naming convention is affected by StreamIdPrefix and ApplyPrefixToStreamID settings in the data source configuration.

    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP supported features For certain data types, the adapter supports applying bitmaps and applying data conversion. Bitmap application The adapter supports applying bitmaps to the value converted from reading the Modbus TCP devices. A bitmap is a series of numbers used to extract and reorder bits from a word register. The format of the bitmap is uuvvwwxxyyzz , where uu , vv , ww , yy , and zz each refer to a single bit. Bitmaps require a leading zero if the referenced bit is less than 10. The low-order bit is 01 and high-order bit is either 16 or 32. Bitmaps can reference up to 16 bits for a 16-bit word (data types 10 and 20) and up to 32 bits for a 32-bit word (data type 30 and 31). For example, the bitmap 0307120802 maps the second bit of the original word to the first bit of the new word, the eighth bit to the second bit, the twelfth bit to the third bit, and so on. The high-order bits of the new word are padded with zeros if they are not specified. Not all data types support bitmapping. The data types that support bitmaps include: Int16 (Data type code 10 ) UInt16 (Data type code 20 ) Int32 (Data type code 30 and 31 ) Data conversion application The adapter supports applying data conversion to the value converted from reading Modbus TCP devices. You can specify a conversion factor and conversion offset. The conversion factor is used for scaling the value up or down and the conversion offset is used for shifting the value. The mathematical equation for conversion is represented below: <After Conversion> = <Before Conversion> / Factor - Offset Not all data types support applying data conversion. Data types that support data conversion include: Int16 (Data type code 10 ) UInt16 (Data type code 20 ) Int32 (Data type code 30 and 31 ) Float32 (Data type code 100 and 101 ) The value with data conversion applied is always converted to the 32-bit float type to maintain the precision of the conversion factor and conversion offset."

    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP overview The OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP is a data-collection component that transfers time-series data from source devices to OMF endpoints in OSIsoft Cloud Services or PI Servers. Modbus TCP is a commonly available communication protocol used for connecting and transmitting information between industrial electronic devices. The adapter can connect to any device that uses the Modbus TCP communication protocol. The adapter is installed with a download kit obtained from the OSIsoft Customer Portal and works on devices running either Windows or Linux operating systems. All functions of the adapter are configured using REST API. The configurations are stored in JSON files. For data ingress, an adapter component must be defined in the system components configuration for each device to which the adapter will connect. Each adapter component is then configured with the connection information for the device and the data to collect. For data egress, configuration is needed to specify destinations for the data, including security for the outgoing connection. Additional configurations are available to egress health and diagnostics data, add buffering configuration to protect against data loss, and record logging information for troubleshooting purposes. Once the adapter is configured and sending data, administration functions are used to manage the adapter or individual ingress components of the adapter. Health and diagnostics functions monitor the status of connected devices, adapter system functions, the number of active data streams, the rate of data ingress, the rate of errors, and the rate of data egress. The EdgeCmd utility is an OSIsoft proprietary command line tool that is used to configure and administer an adapter on both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is installed separately from the adapter."
